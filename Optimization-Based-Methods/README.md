README for Optimization Based methods
Principles of Machine Learning 
## Module 5: Optimization Based Methods 

This folder contains introductory video lectures and slides to familiarize students with optimization methods like neural networks and Support Vector Machines

## Labs

**Lab 5 -Optimization Based Machine Learning** 

In this lab you will explore the use of optimization-based machine learning models. Optimization-based
models are powerful and widely used in machine learning. Specifically, in this lab you will investigated:
- Neural network models for classification.
- Support vector machine models for regression.



## Data

This lab continues using the diabetes patient classification information for over 100,000 patients is in *diabetic_data.csv*

## Code

The code for Lab 5 can be found in a starting experiment from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery that can be copied into your Azure ML Workspace using the link for your preferred programming language below:

- **[R](https://aka.ms/edx-dat203.2x-lab5-class-r)**
- **[Python](https://aka.ms/edx-dat203.2x-lab5-class-py)**
