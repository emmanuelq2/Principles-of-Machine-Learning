## Labs

**Lab 5 -Tree-Based Models** 

In this lab you will explore the use of optimization-based machine learning models. Optimization-based
models are powerful and widely used in machine learning. Specifically, in this lab you will investigated:
- Neural network models for classification.
- Support vector machine models for regression.



## Data

This lab continues using the diabetes patient classification information for over 100,000 patients is in *diabetic_data.csv*

The information in some of these features (columns) is in a coded format; e.g. A14, A11. You can see the meaning of these codes on the UCI Machine Learning repository at
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data).

## Code

The code for Lab 5 can be found in a starting experiment from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery that can be copied into your Azure ML Workspace using the link for your preferred programming language below:
