README for Clustering and Recommenders
Principles of Machine Learning 
## Module 6: Clustering and Recommenders

This folder contains introductory video lectures and slides to familiarize students with the concepts and techniques of using clustering and recommenders

## Slides  

**Clustering** contains an overview of clustering theory.

**Clustering Models** contains a short practical introduction to building and evaluating clustering models.

**Recommender Systems** contains an overview of recommender systems and matrix factorization.

**Recommender Models** contains a short practical introduction to building and evaluating clustering models.

## Labs

**Lab 6 - Unsupervised Learning** : In this lab, you will use Azure Machine Learning to build unsupervised learning models.

**Lab U1 - Clustering - Demographics** provides students with a hands-on overview of unsupervised learning using k-means clustering. In this lab, students perform cluster analysis of a demographic (census) dataset. Different numbers of clusters are evaluated to determine the best fit to the structure of the dataset.

## Data

**Lab 6** uses census income data in *Adult Census Income Binary Classication dataset.csv*

**Lab U1** The forest fire dataset for Lab T2 is in the file titled, *Adult Census Income Binary Classification dataset.csv*. These files are available in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).

## Code

The code for Lab 6 are in the following files
- Stats.R

There is no code required for **Lab U1**

## Gallery

Lab U1 full solution can be found in the Azure ML Gallery: [Cluster Analysis](http://gallery.azureml.net/Details/96a27128190d4dd38d861c59fb3f2abc)
