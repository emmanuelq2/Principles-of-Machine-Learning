## Labs

**Lab 6 - Unsupervised Learning** 

In this lab, you will use Azure Machine Learning to build unsupervised learning models.


## Data

This lab uses census income data in *Adult Census Income Binary Classication dataset.csv*

The information in some of these features (columns) is in a coded format; e.g. A14, A11. You can see the meaning of these codes on the UCI Machine Learning repository at
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data).

## Code

The code for Lab 6 are in the following files
- Stats.R

## Gallery

**Lab 6** full solution can be found in the Azure ML Gallery

- Solution 1 [Need Link]
- Solution 2 [Need Link]

## Videos
