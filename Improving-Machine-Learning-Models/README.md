## Labs

**Lab 3 - Improving Machine Learning Models** 

In this lab you will explore techniques for improving and evaluating the performance of machine
learning models.

## Data

This lab continues using the diabetes patient classification information for over 100,000 patients is in *diabetic_data.csv*


## Code

The code for Lab 3 can be found in a starting experiment from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery that can be copied into your Azure ML Workspace using the link for your preferred programming language below:

**Introduction to Regression**

- **[Introduction to Linear Regression](https://youtu.be/VLEuvTFwSjE)** recaps the concepts of linear regression and evaluating regression models, as well as provides a case study demo.
- **[Multiple Linear Regression](https://youtu.be/W-Cy7DqM7rk)** introduces multiple linear regression that takes the usual regression setup, but accounts for various factors. 
- **[Evaluating Regression Models](https://youtu.be/k-KZ6UdYf44)** talks about evaluating a regression model to figure out the accuracy of the predicted functions. 
- **[A Simple Regression Simulation with R](https://youtu.be/w_N4RQRJyF4)** demonstrates how to use simulated data to create a basic linear regression model with R
- **[A Simple Regression Simulation with Python](https://youtu.be/XSaU1sHzVdU)** demonstrates how to use simulated data to create a basic linear regression model with Python
- **[Increased Error Simulation in R](https://youtu.be/8nIxlYvdCWw)** shows the effect of increased error on a regression model, using R 
- **[Increased Error Simulation in Python](https://youtu.be/9V9AxseRGw4)** shows the effect of increased error on a regression model, using Python
