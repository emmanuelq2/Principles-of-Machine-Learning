## Materials for teaching  

Welcome to Principles of Machine Learning. We hope you will find the material provided here useful and compelling. 

## Overview  

This repository contains material for teaching the essential concepts of *data science and machine learning*. The material is built around a series of hands-on lab exercises. The labs are organized into the folders by subject. The material in each folder includes:

- A **README** describing the contents of the folder.
- The **lab documents** themselves, containing step by step directions.  
- Links to a **worked examples** of the labs in the Azure Machine Learning Gallery.  
- Any **code and data files** required for the lab.  
- **Lecture slides**.
- Links to professionally produced **video lectures**.
 
An annotated Table of Contents describing the material in each folder by category can be found below.   

## Getting Started  

You must download the files in this repository to perform the labs and use the other material. You can download the files in this repository in one of two ways. 

- You can download the repository as a **Zip file** by clicking on the **Download ZIP** button in the lower right of the repository main page. Place the **Zip file** in a convenient directory. Click on the **Zip file** icon and select **Extract Here**. You will see the directory structure of the repository extracted. 
- If you are an advanced user, and have **Git Desktop** installed on your computer, you can **Clone** the repository by clicking the **Clone in Desktop** button in the lower right of the repository main page. Your **Clone** will replicate the directory structure of this repository. Information on installing [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) is available online. 

Once you have downloaded the files in this repository continue your setup. Navigate to the **Setup** directory. Open the **Setup-Guide** document and follow the directions. You are then be ready to try some of the lab exercises! 

## Organization  

The labs in this repository are organized into the folders by subject modules. Each folder includes the following materials as appropriate:  

### Lab Exercises

The core of the material in each folder is one or more lab exercises. Each lab provides a hands on experience focused on a specific aspect of data science and machine learning. Each lab document provides step by instructions. 

Some labs are suitable for all students, including business students. Other labs require more advanced techniques, such as R or Python programming. 

### Data and Code

The labs use a variety of tools. All labs use the Azure Machine Learning Studio environment.

Many of the labs use sample datasets provided in Azure ML. Any additional required data can be found in the folders.  

Some labs use R and Python code, which is provided in the folder with the lab. Code can be run by cut and pasting the code and following the directions in the lab documents. 

### Gallery

The final versions of the experiments constructed in each lab are provided in the Azure Machine Learning Gallery. Follow the links provided in the READ me of each folder to view these experiments.  

### Video and Lecture Material

Each category of labs is complemented by professionally produced video lectures. Links to these videos are provided in the README of each folder. The video files themselves are not included in this repository. 

Lecture slides are provided for each module. The PowerPoint files are in the folders along with the lab documents. 

## Contents

This section contains a summary of the contents of each folder. 

- [**Before you Start** ](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Before-you-start) contain a video that introduces the course as well as vidoes on setting up Azure ML and installing R and Python.
- [**Classification**] (https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Classification) contains vidoes that introduce classification and explains how to build classification models. In the lab, you will train and evaluate a two-class logistic regression classifier model.
- [**Regression**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Regression) contains vidoes that introduce regression and explains how to create regression models. In this lab, you will train and evaluate a regression model to predict the demand in a bicycle rental system.
- [**Improving Machine Learning Models**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Improving-Machine-Learning-Models) contains videos and labs. The videos cover the principle and techninques for model improvement. In this lab you will explore techniques for improving and evaluating the performance of machine learning models. You will continue to work with the diabetes patient classification dataset.
- [**Tree and Ensemble Methods**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Tree-and-Ensemble-Methods) contains videos and labs to help students understand decision trees and ensemble methods. In this lab you will explore the use of tree-based machine learning models. The diabetes patient classification dataset will be used.
- [**Optimization Based Methods**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Optimization-Based-Methods) contains videos and labs. The vidoes cover Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In this lab you will explore the use of optimization-based machine learning models.
- [**Clustering and Recommenders**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Clustering-and-Recommenders) contains videos that discuss clustering and recommenders. In the labs first, you will create a K-Means clustering model that clusters adults based on census information. Then you will create another unsupervised learning model, a recommender for a movie service.
 

## Labs for Technical Users using R or Python

The following labs teach students advanced techniques using the the R or Python language. Each of these labs offer parallel tracks for either R or Python language users.  

- **[Lab 1 - Classification with Logistic Regression*](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Classification)**: In this lab, you will train and evaluate a two-class logistic regression classifier model.
- [**Lab 2 - Regression Models**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Regression): In this lab, you will train and evaluate a regression model. Like classification, regression is a supervised machine learning technique in which a set of data with known labels is used to train and test a model.
- [**Lab 3 - Improving Machine Learning Models**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Improving-Machine-Learning-Models): In this lab you will explore techniques for improving and evaluating the performance of machine learning models.
- [**Lab 4 - Tree Based Models**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Tree-and-Ensemble-Methods): In this lab you will explore the use of tree-based machine learning models.
- [**Lab 5 - Optimization Based Machine Learning**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Optimization-Based-Methods): In this lab you will explore the use of optimization-based machine learning models.
- [**Lab 6 - Unsupervised Learning**](https://github.com/snapanalytx/Principles-of-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Clustering-and-Recommenders): In this lab, you will use Azure Machine Learning to build unsupervised learning models.
