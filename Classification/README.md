## Slides  

**SLIDE 1**  [NEED SLIDES]

**SLIDE 2**  [NEED SLIDES]

**SLIDE 3**  [NEED SLIDES]

## Labs

**Lab 1 - Classification with Logistic Regression** 

 In this lab, you will train and evaluate a two-class logistic regression classifier model.

## Data

This lab uses two data sets:

An admissions map is in *admissions_mapping.csv*

Diabetic patient information for over 100,000 patients is in *diabetic_data.csv*


## Code

The code for Lab 1 are in the following files:

- CleanAdmissions.R
- CleanAdmissions.py
- SeaDiagCodes.R
- SetDiagCodes.py
- SetReadmit.R
- SetReadmit.py
- VisualizeDiabetes.R
- VisualizeDiabetes.py

## Gallery

**Lab 1** full solution can be found in the Azure ML Gallery

- Solution 1 [Need Link]
- Solution 2 [Need Link]
