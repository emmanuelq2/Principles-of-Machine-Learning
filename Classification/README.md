README for Classification
# Principles of Machine Learning 
## Module 1: Classification

This folder contains introductory video lectures and slides to familiarize students with the basic concepts of data classification. 

## Slides  

**SLIDE 1**  [NEED SLIDES]

**SLIDE 2**  [NEED SLIDES]

**SLIDE 3**  [NEED SLIDES]

## Labs

**Lab 1 - Classification with Logistic Regression** 

 In this lab, you will train and evaluate a two-class logistic regression classifier model.
 
**C1 - Classification - Credit Risk** is a complete case study, suitable for business users. Students create and evaluate machine learning models to classify bank credit customers as good or bad.

**C2 - Classification - Targeted Marketing** is a complete case study, suitable for business users. Students classify customers as interested or not in an offer.

## Data

This lab uses two data sets:

An admissions map is in *admissions_mapping.csv*

Diabetic patient information for over 100,000 patients is in *diabetic_data.csv*


## Code

The code for Lab 1 are in the following files:

- CleanAdmissions.R
- CleanAdmissions.py
- SeaDiagCodes.R
- SetDiagCodes.py
- SetReadmit.R
- SetReadmit.py
- VisualizeDiabetes.R
- VisualizeDiabetes.py
