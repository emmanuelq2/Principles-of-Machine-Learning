## Labs

**Lab 4 -Tree-Based Models** 

In this lab you will explore the use of tree-based machine learning models. Tree-based models are
powerful and widely used in machine learning. Specifically, in this lab you will investigated:
- Using ADA-boosted tree models for classification.
- Using decision forest models for regression.


## Data

This lab continues using the diabetes patient classification information for over 100,000 patients is in *diabetic_data.csv*

## Code

The code for Lab 3 can be found in a starting experiment from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery that can be copied into your Azure ML Workspace using the link for your preferred programming language below:

## Videos  

Videos introducing the principles of decision trees and ensemble methods can be found in the links below:

**Introduction to Decision Trees**

- **[Decision Trees](https://youtu.be/XOl702kPWcw)** describes how decision trees work and understanding their strengths and weaknesses
- **[Information](https://youtu.be/GQibJ7_AIrY)** explains the meaning of "information" in mathematical context

**Ensemble Methods**

- **[Boosting](https://youtu.be/VzdDaPfXz_M)** explains boosting, which attempts to improves weak algorithms which are no better than guessing.
- **[Adaboost Example](https://youtu.be/tJl3fUWvisk)** conceptual overview of the Asaboost algorithm with accompanying example
- **[Coordinate Descent](https://youtu.be/_c1fubz5Drw)** provides an alternative perspective to Adaboost and explains the origin of the coefficients
- **[Boosted Tree R Demo](https://youtu.be/cx7OMd5rAKg)** demonstrates how to apply a boosted tree model to a bicycle regression dataset, using R
- **[Decision Forests](https://youtu.be/PRQnyggMOAw)** introduces the concept of decision forests, which combine models to reduce variance
- **[Decision Forest R Demo](https://youtu.be/PWDX84TBCf8)** demonstrates a pracitcal applicaiton of decision forests, using R.
