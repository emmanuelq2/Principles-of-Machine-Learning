## Labs

**Lab 2 - Classification with Logistic Regression** 

In this lab, you will train and evaluate a regression model. Like classification, regression is a supervised
machine learning technique in which a set of data with known labels is used to train and test a model.
Whereas classification predicts whether or not a label falls into one class or another, regression predicts
a real numeric value for the label

## Data

This lab uses one data set:

Bike rental data is in *Bike Rental UCI dataset.csv* which is also available as a sample dataset in the Azure ML studio.

Diabetic patient information for over 100,000 patients is in *diabetic_data.csv*

The information in some of these features (columns) is in a coded format; e.g. A14, A11. You can see the meaning of these codes on the UCI Machine Learning repository at
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data).

## Code

The code for Lab 2 are in the following files:

- BikeEvaluate.R
- BikeEvaluate.py
- BikeVisualize.R
- BikeVisualize.py
- SetDayofWeek.R
- SetDayOfWeek.py
- SetDays.R
- SetDays.py
