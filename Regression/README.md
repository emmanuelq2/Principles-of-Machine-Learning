README for Regression
# Principles of Machine Learning 
## Module 2: Regression

This folder contains introductory video lectures and slides to familiarize students with the basic concepts of regression 

## Slides  

**Regression** contains an overview of regression theory.    

**Buliding Regression Models** contains a short practical introduction to building and evaluating regression models. 

## Labs

**Lab 2 - Regression Models** 

In this lab, you will train and evaluate a regression model. Like classification, regression is a supervised
machine learning technique in which a set of data with known labels is used to train and test a model.
Whereas classification predicts whether or not a label falls into one class or another, regression predicts
a real numeric value for the label

**Lab R1 - Regression - Forecasting** is a complete case study, suitable for business users. Student create and test a forecasting model for milk production.

## Data

**Lab 2** uses one data set:

- Bike rental data is in *Bike Rental UCI dataset.csv* which is also available as a sample dataset in the Azure ML studio.

- Diabetic patient information for over 100,000 patients is in *diabetic_data.csv*

**Lab R1** uses the data in two files which were constructed from original United States Department of Agriculture data:
- *CADairyProduction-95-12.csv*
- *CADairyProduction-13.csv*

## Code

**Lab 2** The code are in the following files:

- BikeEvaluate.R
- BikeEvaluate.py
- BikeVisualize.R
- BikeVisualize.py
- SetDayofWeek.R
- SetDayOfWeek.py
- SetDays.R
- SetDays.py

**Lab R1** requires **no code**

## Gallery

**Lab R1** full solution can be found in the Azure ML Gallery:
